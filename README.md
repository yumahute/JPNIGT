# Fixed point
Before going to the next card, the subject makes a sound in our program, but not in PEBL.
If the chosen card has a lose, the card is black in our program, but red in PEBL.
The reason for making lose red is the sentence from the left side of p.2192 of Bechara et al. (2000), starting from line 21, where it says that cards with minus or 0 in the schedule in Table 1 on p.2193 are made red. This seems to be to make the color of the 40 cards half red and half black.
